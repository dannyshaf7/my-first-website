            <h3>November 20, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                I started building my first website today, from scratch. <br>
                I learned in the NCL Competition that the web is a big knowledge gap. <br>
                Luckily, my final project for Pen Testing involves site creation! <br>
                I am excited to see what I can accomplish in the coming weeks!
            </p>
            <h3>November 21, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                I started building more pages for my website. <br>
                I have already learned lots about HTML and a bit about CSS. <br>
                Adding an image and linking pages was much simpler than expected. <br>
                I am excited to see where this project goes next!
            </p>
            <h3>November 23, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                Today, I am thinking about content and purpose. <br>
                This website will primarily be used for my Pen-testing Final Project. <br>
                I think the next step should be to create a space for presenting a tutorial. <br>
                I perceive formatting to be a major hurdle, we'll see!
            </p>
            <h4>November 30, 2024</h4>
            <p>
                I passed my first certification exam yesterday! <br>
                Studying for that is what kept me away from working on the site. <br>
                Now that it's done I have made some additions. <br>
                For my final project, I must create a tutorial. <br>
                I did the research, worked through some examples, and got images. <br>
                I reached out to the org that created the labs I used to see if <br>
                they have any acceptable use standards for sharing lab details publicly. <br>
                It is currently hosted locally so I will continue to build while hoping <br>
                for the best. They are closed on the weekend so it'll be a bit. <br>
