                I started building my first website today, from scratch. <br>
                I learned in the NCL Competition that the web is a big knowledge gap. <br>
                Luckily, my final project for Pen Testing involves site creation! <br>
                I am excited to see what I can accomplish in the coming weeks!

            <h3>November 21, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                I started building more pages for my website. <br>
                I have already learned lots about HTML and a bit about CSS. <br>
                Adding an image and linking pages was much simpler than expected. <br>
                I am excited to see where this project goes next!
