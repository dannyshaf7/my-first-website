                    I started building my first website today, from scratch. <br>
                    I learned in the NCL Competition that the web is a big knowledge gap. <br>
                    Luckily, my final project for Pen Testing involves site creation! <br>
                    I am excited to see what I can accomplish in the coming weeks!

                    <p>
                        I started building more pages for my website. <br>
                        I have already learned lots about HTML and a bit about CSS. <br>
                        Adding an image and linking pages was much simpler than expected. <br>
                        I am excited to see where this project goes next!

                        Today, I am thinking about content and purpose. <br>
                        This website will primarily be used for my Pen-testing Final Project. <br>
                        I think the next step should be to create a space for presenting a tutorial. <br>
                        I perceive formatting to be a major hurdle, we'll see!

                    <p>
                        I passed my first certification exam yesterday! <br>
                        Studying for that is what kept me away from working on the site. <br>
                        Now that it's done I have made some additions. <br>
                        For my final project, I must create a tutorial. <br>
                        I did the research, worked through some examples, and got images. <br>
                        I reached out to the org that created the labs I used to see if <br>
                        they have any acceptable use standards for sharing lab details publicly. <br>
                        It is currently hosted locally so I will continue to build while hoping <br>
                        for the best. They are closed on the weekend so it'll be a bit. <br>

                        Back to working on the website. <br>
                        Work was a mess today so I don't have much energy. <br>
                        I optimized the png images and started adding text to the tutorial page. <br>
                        It's about 1am now. I should sleep but the project is due in less than 24 hours. <br>
                        Oh well, I'll try and get some shut-eye. The hard parts are done. <br>
