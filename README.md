# My First Website

Welcome to the repository for my first static website project! This site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great starting point for learning web development.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a basic example of how to structure and display content using HTML. The project includes:
- A simple homepage with headings and paragraphs.
- Basic styling with CSS.
- Placeholder content (text and images).

## Features

- **Responsive layout**: The design adjusts for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Basic structure**: The website contains a main `index.html` file, linked to a `styles.css` file for styling and `script.js` for any JavaScript functionality.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-first-website.git
2. **Open the index.html file**:
    You can open the index.html file directly in a web browser (no server required).
3. **Make changes**:
    Edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed. Refresh the browser to see changes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the content.
- CSS3: For styling the website.
- JavaScript: For any interactive elements (to be added in future updates).

## Future Plans

- Add more pages and sections to the website.
- Enhance the layout with advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
- Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., form validation, animations).
